# satellite_water_temperature_extraction

This script was written in Google Earthe Engine, all you would need is the location of your interest. 

In order to use the scipt, change the location of "point" to where ever you are interested in, then paste into Google Earth Engine to run. 

This script graphs the water temperature, also download the data with specific time of data (which graphs does not display) into Google Drive in CSV form.


!!!Use at your own risk!!!
